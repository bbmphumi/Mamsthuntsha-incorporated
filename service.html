            Mining and Petroleum Law.
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Mineral Petroleum and Resources Development Act of 2002 has presented a new era in the mining and prospecting 
            of Minerals in the Republic of South Africa. We advise small to medium Black Economic Empowerment entities involved
             in various Mining transactions. The new mining legislation and the Mining Charter seeks to ensure maximum
              participation by previously disadvantaged Individuals in the sector and we as a firm strongly believe that 
              we can contribute in furthering the objectives of the Charter 
              by way of providing the necessary legal advice based on the hands on knowledge that we at Mamathuntsha Inc 
              Attorneys possess. Mr Mamathuntsha further holds a certificate in oil and Gas Law from the University 
              of Cape Town. This has further consolidated his knowledge in the energy law space. Over the years the company 
              has given legal advice to small to medium sized mining companies, including advising and drafting on major sale
               of mining shares agreements. Mr Mamathuntsha, the Director has previously worked at the Department of Minerals 
               and Energy where he worked with Mineral Laws Administration, this included processing of Mining Right 
               applications, Prospecting rights as Mining Permits, attending to monitoring the Notarizing of Mining Permits 
               when granted by the Minister. <br> <br>

               The Director gained valuable experience that he continues to use as he advises clients in the area of Mining law. <br>      <br>

               The company intends to boldly and proudly establish an organization that is better and adequately positioned
                to meet the democratic challenges offered by the post-1994 economic dispensation, which includes inter alia 
                the transformation of the previously disenfranchised apartheid period. The strategy of the company is informed
                 by an ambition to enter the industry as a knowledgeable entity with expertise that are highly sensitive to 
                 the equality and social justice challenges that face millions of  South Africans. Both the Director and the
                  Consultant, Mr K  Khoza are specialists  entertainment law attorneys and have over the years presented 
                  various workshops and radio discussions on entertainment law.

            Civil and Commercial Litigation

            Litigation in the civil courts has been the primary way of resolving civil and commercial disputes. 
            However, the court process is proving not to be the most efficient forum for dispute resolution.  
            The firm's approach is to advice our clients on the best mechanism for dispute resolution and using 
            the courts as a last resort. Members of the firm have experience in Magistrates Court and High Court litigation.

            Trade Marks Law 
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Trademarks  Act defines the function of trademark as distinguishing one person`s goods 
            ( or services) from those of another. It therefore follows that trademarks are registered for 
            certain goods or categories.  <br> <br>

            A trade mark is essentially a means of identifying a product, whether goods or services.
             It is usually a brand name but it can be any sign capable of being represented graphically, 
             including a picture, signature, colour, numeral, shape, configuration, pattern, sound or a  
             container for goods, or any combination of these. <br> <br>

             One way of protecting your brand and its reputation is to obtain a registered 
             trademark protection by registering it with the relevant authorities. <br> <br>

             Our work involves conducting searches, prosecuting in the High court and the Registrar 
             of Trade Marks any possible infringements of our client`s Marks and giving the necessary 
             Legal advice. This area of practice flows from the body of Law called Intellectual Property Law,
             Anti-Counterfeiting being one of the areas we practice in including Design Law.

             matters facing any organisation, as they impact directly on productivity and reputation.
